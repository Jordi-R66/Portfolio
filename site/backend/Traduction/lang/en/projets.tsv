tle_title	TLE-Decoder
tle_type	Personal project - 2024
tle_desc1	Having (almost) always been passionate about aerospace, je me suis forcément intéressé à la manière dont l'on pouvait "prédire" la position de n'importe quel objet en orbite, et la calculer en temps réel.
tle_desc2	À la fin de la Terminale, en 2024, j'ai donc commencé à travailler sur ce projet. Je me base sur les lois de Kepler pour ensuite déterminer l'emplacement de n'importe quel satellite (y compris l'ISS ou le télescope Hubble) en fonction de l'heure et de ses paramètres orbitaux (TLE).
tle_desc3	Le programme principal (le backend) est codé en C, c'est lui qui effectue les calculs mathématiques et gère les données. Le téléchargement des TLE est lui géré par un script Python. Un prototype du programme a été réalisé en Python.

jav_title	Jav'Enchère
jav_type	Academic project
jav_desc1	For the third semester's SAÉ of my CS Bachelor, I helped developing a secured closed-bid auction service.
jav_desc2	It actually is Vickrey's auction model, A model relying on games theory. In which the highest bidder wins the auction but only pays the amount of the second highest bid.
jav_desc3	I was mainly tasked with assuring the connection and communication of our solution. I wrote all the necessary code to communicate between users and with the server. I also assured the communications encryption with SSL/TLS via a self-signed certificate, et the use of RSA 4096. Both the GUI and the logic behind the auction system were assured by my teammates.
jav_thanks	I would like to thank <a class="lien inclusion_texte" href="https://flothival.github.io/Florent_LABROUSSE-LHUISSIER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--red);">Florent</a> and <a class="lien inclusion_texte" href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--red);">Rayane</a> for all of their work in that SAÉ.
sos_title	The Symphony Of Stars
sos_type	Code Game Jam - 2025
sos_desc1	In January 2025, I was part of a team participating to the Code Game Jam, an event open to every student in public institutions of French-speaking countries, during which we had thirty-ish hours to develop a whole video game with a given theme. That year, the theme was "Infinite melody".
sos_desc2	We decided to create a game we would call "Symphony of Stars", mostly inspired of games such as Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen, with the addition of musical dimension to match the theme.
sos_desc3	My contribution to the game consisted of the elaboration of the different necessary coordinates systems. Indeed, libGDX doesn't natively handle 3D, it is actually a pretty simple library based on LWJGL (the lib behind Minecraft). Therefore the only coordinates the lib knows are the X, Y coordinates of the pixels in its window.
sos_desc4	I built the 3D coordinates allowing to place the different stars, spaceship-relative 3D coordinates, along with 3D polar coordinates as an intermediary for the camera. In a more anecdotal manner I also implemented the apparent size of the stars. Because we don't have genuine 3D in our game, only some basic trigonometry.
sos_desc5	I also helped implementing the ship's motion along and around all three axis: the ship is capable of translating et rotating on all 3 axis: X, Y and Z.
sos_thanks	I want to thank <a class="lien inclusion_texte" href="https://bastienluben.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--red);">Bastien</a>, <a class="lien inclusion_texte" href="https://rybois-dev.github.io/portfolio/src/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--red);">Clément</a> and <a class="lien inclusion_texte" href="https://dellarolir.github.io/Romain_Dellaroli.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: var(--red);">Romain</a> for participating to the 2025 edition of the Code Game Jam, paticularly for all of the passion invested during these thirty hours.

lib_title	myOwnCLib
lib_type	Personal project
lib_desc1	This project was born out of the need of understanding the abstractions behind high-level languages. The goal is to create "from scratch" a modular C standard library that is both portable and powerful.
lib_desc2	I implemented generic data structures (linked lists, matrices, stacks) and a rigourous handling of dynamic memory allocation.
lib_desc3	The most technical part of the project is the <strong>VariableSizeInt</strong> (BigInt) module, it handles arbitrarly-sized integers, including modular arithmetics, and in a near future Karatsuba's multiplication.
